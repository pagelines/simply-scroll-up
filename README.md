### What is Simply Scroll Up for? ###

An essential plugin that you need in your tool box. So simple and elegant, Simply Scroll Up gets you back to the top of your page with style and grace. Easy to setup and easier to use.

Long page sites are very fashionable and they look great. Back To Top provides an effortless way for users to get back to the top of the page. Hey, it doesn’t have to be a long page site it could even be for sites that have pages that are really long.

There is no need to do any coding or even use a shortcode. It really couldn’t be simpler.

You have all the choices you need and Back To Top gives you four options: Text, Image, Pill, Tab. Once set it will automatically appear as the user scrolls down the page.

You can decide where on the page the link will appear by using the padding options. Once the user clicks the link the magic starts, the page will scroll up and as the user reaches the top so the link smoothly disappears.

And we have tried to think of everything, just in case you are using another element on the page and the link gets hidden, you can adjust the z index.
